This repository is designed to store the tensor network variational methods studied and developed by the i3B team in a public way. The main interest is the industrial case, but some methods can be used in basic research cases.

The packages used are Numpy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow and PyTorch, depending on the case. Usually also Numba.

Specific Tensor Networks packages used are TensorNetwork and Quimb.

Check the first part of each Notebook to see which set of packages you need to install.
